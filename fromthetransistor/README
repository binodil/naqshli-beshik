Integrated Circuits (ICs) are simply a square of silicon which has electric circuit, numerious transistors, wires and other electric devices.
IC are possible thanks to first inventors Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce (1958). Chips are not build upon wood, stones, it is built on semiconductor crystal. Conductor is a material which allow a flow of electricity. The chip starts as a thin wafer of P-type silicon. Components are added at certain temperature. Chemecals are added to block alectricty or to allow at certain places. NEx wafer layer is added on top of that wafer.

Who is Shockley? What was his idea in 1945?He failed to build it?
1948, Brattain and Bardeeen build first working transistor, the germanium point-contact transistor. Then what kind of architecture he applied to the chip design?
Based on his idea, John Atalla developed a new IC. What is it in 1960?
TOday most IC are based on John Atalla idea.
What is MOS-FETS?

What is the desing of it? So transistor has 3 IO, power, in and out. then makes incoming signal 0 or 1.

Lessons from the Early Days of Semiconductors: https://youtu.be/qhJaq3kl6Dc?si=nRYI31Lxn2ad3liF
1799 - Volta (Battery) (stack of item with zink)
1831 - Faraday
what is a galvanometer?
1833? - Semiconductors wheatstone bridge

He is able to measure the resistance of natural mineral, metals. He liked a silver based conductor. That was a semiconductor. Silver solfied, the resistance got less as it is heated up. Faraday is a smart guy. 
1877 - Braun | He was interested in why a lot of minerals act in that way?
1879 - Hall (U.S. graduate) - Hall Effect. What is it? Hint: before the electron discovery and positive and negative electrons are not discovered.
1906 (Pickard) Silicon Point contact detector | What is the first application of the semiconductor? R**** in ship. He made experiments with different materials to buiild consistant semiconductor detector.
1907 - 1911  Baedeker | COntrolled Doping of Semiconductor
1920s - Home Crystal Sets
1925 - Lilienfeld | MESFET - No amplifiers at that time in radio receivers. He wanted to build amplifier which a semiconductor.
1928 - Lilienfeld - MOSFET - Metal oxyde semiconductor Field Effect transistor. Every modern device uses it in 21th century

1928 - 1931 : Bloch, Peierls, Wilson, Pauli, Heuisenberg, Band Picture |  
1939 WWII began. Everybody in the war.
1940 - 1946 MIT RAD Lab in U.S. | People are working in vacuum tubes, radio. But radar sets tot he airplanes in the military
Our story of Controlled electric current

1941 - Rad Lab
What is the silicon - It is a material. Silicon breast, silicon valley. Silicon is achemical element.Atom number is 14. (Si). Adundant element next to the oxygen.
1942 - Schottky Barrier theory & Experiment
# Key | Point-Contact Transistor | A contractor for the Rad Lab
1948 - Bardeen & Brattain | Point-Contact Transistor

How the machine code actually controls the chip!?

1955 - Derik & Frosch | Diffusion | Oxyde Masking!!!

Diffuse the things right, you can diffuse. It is a diffused silicon transistor.
Diffusion technique happends in the certain temperature and in certain temperature you can add more items.
1956 - Tannenbaum, Thomas, Lee. Huge success
1954 - PSI (Pasific semiconductor industry? (Is it correct)
Bright Ph.D form new company the diffusion. F company

1959 - Kilby - All-semiconductor circuit in a semiconductor.
Technology is booming!!!!!
Planar Process - 1959 Hoerni | From "Makers of the microchips"!

We can use NandGame (simulator) 

Default Off relay
C: 1 and in: 1 --> return 1
C:0 and in: 1 --> return 0
C:1 and in:0 --> return 0
C:0 and in:0 --> return 0

Default ON relay
C:1 and in: 1 --> return 0
C:0 and in: 1 --> return 1
C:1 and in: 0 --> return 0
C:0 and in: 0 --> return 0
#--------------------------------

nand component: (it must real)
a: 1 and b: 1 -> 0
a: 0 and b: 1 -> 1
a: 0 and b: 0 -> 1
a:1 and b: 0 -> 1
