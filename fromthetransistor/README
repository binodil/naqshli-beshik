Table of content:
1. Cheating our way past the transistor.
2. What language is hardware coded in?
3. Processor. What is a processor anyway?
4. Compiler. A 'high' level language.
5. Operating System: Software we take for granted.
6. Browser: Coming online.
7. Physical: Running on real hardware.



1. Cheating our way past the transistor
  - Transistor and relay and switches. How vacuum transistors work?
  - Truly parallel?!
  - Describe how FPGAs are buildable using transistors?
 
  - Is ICs are just collections of transistors?
  - What is LUTs?
