Integrated Circuits (ICs) are simply a square of silicon which has electric circuit, numerious transistors, wires and other electric devices.
IC are possible thanks to first inventors Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce (1958). Chips are not build upon wood, stones, it is built on semiconductor crystal. Conductor is a material which allow a flow of electricity. The chip starts as a thin wafer of P-type silicon. Components are added at certain temperature. Chemecals are added to block alectricty or to allow at certain places. NEx wafer layer is added on top of that wafer.

Who is Shockley? What was his idea in 1945?He failed to build it?
1948, Brattain and Bardeeen build first working transistor, the germanium point-contact transistor. Then what kind of architecture he applied to the chip design?
Based on his idea, John Atalla developed a new IC. What is it in 1960?
TOday most IC are based on John Atalla idea.
What is MOS-FETS?

What is the desing of it? So transistor has 3 IO, power, in and out. then makes incoming signal 0 or 1.

Lessons from the Early Days of Semiconductors: https://youtu.be/qhJaq3kl6Dc?si=nRYI31Lxn2ad3liF
1799 - Volta (Battery) (stack of item with zink)
1831 - Faraday
what is a galvanometer?
1833? - Semiconductors wheatstone bridge

He is able to measure the resistance of natural mineral, metals. He liked a silver based conductor. That was a semiconductor. Silver solfied, the resistance got less as it is heated up. Faraday is a smart guy. 
1877 - Braun | He was interested in why a lot of minerals act in that way?
1879 - Hall (U.S. graduate) - Hall Effect. What is it? Hint: before the electron discovery and positive and negative electrons are not discovered.
1906 (Pickard) Silicon Point contact detector | What is the first application of the semiconductor? R**** in ship. He made experiments with different materials to buiild consistant semiconductor detector.
1907 - 1911  Baedeker | COntrolled Doping of Semiconductor
1920s - Home Crystal Sets
1925 - Lilienfeld | MESFET - No amplifiers at that time in radio receivers. He wanted to build amplifier which a semiconductor.
1928 - Lilienfeld - MOSFET - Metal oxyde semiconductor Field Effect transistor. Every modern device uses it in 21th century

1928 - 1931 : Bloch, Peierls, Wilson, Pauli, Heuisenberg, Band Picture |  
1939 WWII began. Everybody in the war.
1940 - 1946 MIT RAD Lab in U.S. | People are working in vacuum tubes, radio. But radar sets tot he airplanes in the military
Our story of Controlled electric current

1941 - Rad Lab
What is the silicon - It is a material. Silicon breast, silicon valley. Silicon is achemical element.Atom number is 14. (Si). Adundant element next to the oxygen.
1942 - Schottky Barrier theory & Experiment
# Key | Point-Contact Transistor | A contractor for the Rad Lab
1948 - Bardeen & Brattain | Point-Contact Transistor

How the machine code actually controls the chip!?

1955 - Derik & Frosch | Diffusion | Oxyde Masking!!!

Diffuse the things right, you can diffuse. It is a diffused silicon transistor.
Diffusion technique happends in the certain temperature and in certain temperature you can add more items.
1956 - Tannenbaum, Thomas, Lee. Huge success
1954 - PSI (Pasific semiconductor industry? (Is it correct)
Bright Ph.D form new company the diffusion. F company

1959 - Kilby - All-semiconductor circuit in a semiconductor.
Technology is booming!!!!!
Planar Process - 1959 Hoerni | From "Makers of the microchips"!

We can use NandGame (simulator) 

Default Off relay
C: 1 and in: 1 --> return 1
C:0 and in: 1 --> return 0
C:1 and in:0 --> return 0
C:0 and in:0 --> return 0

Default ON relay
C:1 and in: 1 --> return 0
C:0 and in: 1 --> return 1
C:1 and in: 0 --> return 0
C:0 and in: 0 --> return 0
#--------------------------------

nand component: (it must real)
a: 1 and b: 1 -> 0
a: 0 and b: 1 -> 1

#----------RISC-V----------#
RISC-V(five) is an open-source CPU architecture
Most PC uses x86 CPU architecture.
Intel Core is also a cpu architecture. CPU is set of instructions.
AMD Ryzen is also a CPU architecture.
Qualcomm Snapdragon is also CPU architecture.
Apple M1, Nvidia Tegra, Intel Pentium, Intel Atom, Intel 8086, Motorola 6809, Intel Core i7, Intel Core i5, Intel Core i9 (is a architecture name), Nvidia Ampere, AMD k5, AMD Duron, Nvidia Turing, IBM smth, etc. IBM 704 (1950s cpu architecture). 8 bit archtiecture, Intel 8008. Ancestor is Intel 4004 based on binary-coded decimanl (BCD). RISC(reduced instruction set computing) vs CISC (complex instruction set computing). MISC (minimal instruction set computer), , VLIW (Very long instruction word) computers.

CPU architecture in small device and phones it is ARM architecture

RISC-V is similar to ARM, but it is much cleaner and it is open-source.


Verilog is not programming language as python. It is much low-lever
We have bin(0b0000), oct(0o000), hex (0x000)

We have Ops such as LUI, LOAD, STORE, AUIPC, BRANCH, JAL, JALR, IMM, OPS, MISC, SYSTEM
We have Funct3 as ADD, SUB, SLLI, SLYU, XOR, OR, AND, SRL

# this is how the microprocessor are working in the low level. 

Each process has a step: 
  1) Intruction fetch
  2) Instruction decode
    - to J-type instruction
    - to I-type instruction
    - to other instruction
  3) Execute
  4) Access
  5) Write-back

### LESSON: Use several tabs (windows in tmux) to (1) write in vim; (2) run the code; (3) browse source code, etc.
In tmux to switch between tmux, you use arrows use ctrl+numbers. use ctrl+b equivalaent twice to switch to previous window.
In order to create new window use ctrl+c. it creates new window. If you need more hints on shortcuts use <<?>>

Installing Linux distribution to the M series chip is not completed yet. It takes time. The macos with Intel chips, so they have intel cpu archtiecture, they can replace the OS with the linux ubuntu. It is well known method. 



What is the register? In the instruction development?
Regestors are zero, ra, sp, gp, tp, ect.
Each register has ABI Name.
x0 is zero (hard-wired zero). What is a saver? Assembler mnemonics, so x0-x31 they store, return address, stack pointer, global pointer, thread pointer, temporary register, etc, floating point temopraries, etc


There are many types of instructions.

What is the clock in the varelog? Is it the speed of  each single opearion t be ondivte.


How to code in verilog??
filename.v is the sample of the verilog file

WE need a verilog emulator. In MacOS we can use bew install icarus-verilog/ 
In Linux, ypou can use sudo apt install iverilog.


In verilog, you need to think in 4 dimensions. 

Display values in hex, 

We need to implement decoder


Verilog is a language. Memory interface must be implememted.


CPU code of verilog is compiled and deployed to the fpga. CPU is runnning in 50MHz;
Verilog is used to write own chip architecture.
CPU are now running in 6Hz to visually debug and see how it was working.

Inv erilog the indexing in inclusive. arr[1:5], here it is inclusive

Xilinx Zynq is a board name

Accelerator which does not have CCIX, will be out-competed! (Cache Coherent Interconnect for Accelerators)
