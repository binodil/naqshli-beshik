Integrated Circuits (ICs) are simply a square of silicon which has electric circuit, numerious transistors, wires and other electric devices.
IC are possible thanks to first inventors Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce (1958). Chips are not build upon wood, stones, it is built on semiconductor crystal. Conductor is a material which allow a flow of electricity. The chip starts as a thin wafer of P-type silicon. Components are added at certain temperature. Chemecals are added to block alectricty or to allow at certain places. NEx wafer layer is added on top of that wafer.

Who is Shockley? What was his idea in 1945?He failed to build it?
1948, Brattain and Bardeeen build first working transistor, the germanium point-contact transistor. Then what kind of architecture he applied to the chip design?
Based on his idea, John Atalla developed a new IC. What is it in 1960?
TOday most IC are based on John Atalla idea.
What is MOS-FETS?

RISC-V is similar to ARM, but it is much cleaner and it is open-source.


Verilog is not programming language as python. It is much low-lever
We have bin(0b0000), oct(0o000), hex (0x000)

We have Ops such as LUI, LOAD, STORE, AUIPC, BRANCH, JAL, JALR, IMM, OPS, MISC, SYSTEM
We have Funct3 as ADD, SUB, SLLI, SLYU, XOR, OR, AND, SRL

# this is how the microprocessor are working in the low level. 

Each process has a step: 
  1) Intruction fetch
  2) Instruction decode
    - to J-type instruction
    - to I-type instruction
    - to other instruction
  3) Execute
  4) Access
  5) Write-back

### LESSON: Use several tabs (windows in tmux) to (1) write in vim; (2) run the code; (3) browse source code, etc.
In tmux to switch between tmux, you use arrows use ctrl+numbers. use ctrl+b equivalaent twice to switch to previous window.
In order to create new window use ctrl+c. it creates new window. If you need more hints on shortcuts use <<?>>

Installing Linux distribution to the M series chip is not completed yet. It takes time. The macos with Intel chips, so they have intel cpu archtiecture, they can replace the OS with the linux ubuntu. It is well known method.

Okay ! (https://gfxcourses.stanford.edu/cs149/fall22content/media/multicorearch/02_basicarch_HAzYV7A.pdf)
A program is a list of processor instructions!
Your python code --> interpreted into the assembly code.
What does a processor do? It perform computations like binary, trinary, arithmetic. Not exactly!
It executes instructions. To execute each instruction it should fetch, read, execute, and go back again.

In processor, its first task is to determine what instructions to run next. (Fetch/decode)
Next, we use ALU (execution unit) --> execution unit:performs the operation described by an instruction, which may modify values in the processor's registers or the computer's memory.
Lastly, registers: maintain program state: store value of variables used as inputs and outputs to operations.

One instruction can be run per clock.

in the assembly code, it will be like instuction code-whitespace-registers-memory-addr

We have superscalar processor (This processor can decode and execute up to two instructions per clock)

Superscalar execution: processor automatically finds indeoendent instructions in an instruction sequence and can execute them in parallel on multiple execution units. Wow! Two cores means two instructions can be run in parallel. It depends on the intructions, which compiled in assemble. If original code is written with care for multithreading then it can be achieved. In practice you do not receive 2x speed with 2 cores. Instead it might be 1.5x speed or lower.
Does intel sucks too?

Intel Comet Lake 10th generation core i9 10 core cpu. It has 10 cores. So 10 instructions can be run in parallel in theory.

nanochip is the same for cpu and gpu, but because they goal is different the placement of object is different.
NVIDIA Ampere GPU has 84 "SM" blocks (2020)

Intel Xeon Phi Knights Corner has 72 core CPU. That is a massive power, is not it! (2016)


Apple A13: Two big cores + four small cores (2019)
Iphone Xr has A12 chip. They are basaed on ARM architecture. They include superscalar execution. That is awesome.
A12 was launched in 2018. Discontinued in 2022. designed by Apple (actually by a startup chip company). Manufacturer is TSMC. CPU clock rate of A12 is up to 2.49 GHz. Cache L1 cache (128 KB) L2 cache 8 MB. ARM is instruction sets. They used A64-ARMv8.3-A; Number of transistors is 6.9 billions. Cores: 6 cores + GPU cores. A12 has video codec encoding support for HEVC , H.264. So thet chip has instructions for that codecs.

Teardown of Iphone Xr: https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+XR+Teardown/114123


To sum up, there are three different forms of parallel execution in the literature:
1) Superscaler -> exploit ILP within an isntruction stream. Process different instrucitons from the same instruction stream in parallel (within a core).  
2) SIMD: multiple ALUs (Arithmetic logicl units) controlled by same instruction (within a core).
  - Efficient for data-parallel workloads.

3) Multi-core: use multiple processing cores;
  - provides thread-level prallelism. Simulataneously execute a completely different instruction stream on each core.
  - Software created threads to expose parallelism to hardware (via threading API)

Any program's memory is organized as an array of bytes. Each byte is identified by its address in memory. A byte stored at address 0x8 has value of 32. what is 32? We have instuction like load. It means load a value from memory to the register R0 or equivalent.

Stalls:
A processor stalls when it cannot run the next instruction in an instruction stream because of a dependency on a previous instruction that is not yet completed. Major source of stall is low speed or failure in loading from memory to the chip.


Recall, memory is just an array of values!  So processor has registers and these registers values are stored in caches. False!!!!!! Not like that!!!!! Caches such as L1 and L2 are just on-chip memory. You still need to load and store to that memory. Just the loading and storing time will be much better than reading from RAM.
What data does processor decide to keep in cache. Caches are usually very small.Keywords: Direct mapped cache, set-associative cache, cache line?
We can round it as LRU policy for now (least recently used) - to make rooom for new data, throw out the data in the cache that was assessed the longest time ago.

data access time in L1 cache is the fasters. maybe 4 number of cycles in 4 GHz. Data in L2 and L3 are 12 cycles and 38 cycles in 4 GHz clock. Access the data in DRAM in best case 248 cycles in 4 GHz board.

Pre-fetching to the cache reduce the stalls (latency).

Multi-threading reduces stalls> How? they are just a bunch of processors, but still need to access memory anyway!

There is the key takeaway!

What is the bandwidth? 
  - So bandwidth is the number of items can be carried; Lets say you need to do a laundry. Bandwdth is one if you take one cloth, wash, dry total (105 minutes). Badwidth of washer can be improved to 10 kg of cloth.

How would you solve the element-wise vector multiplication of A and B vector of 1 billion values? A for loop?

What is a bandwidth? Why it is a problem?
What is the latency?
How does multi-threading can help us?
How does not GPU care about multi-threading.

Awesome and high quality course is in https://gfxcourses.stanford.edu/cs149/fall24/

Learning GPU and CUDA but faster: https://gfxcourses.stanford.edu/cs149/fall22content/media/multicorearch/02_basicarch_HAzYV7A.pdf

Do the programming assignments!! Simple renderer in CUDA, Optimzie DNN, Schedule task, etc

Standford resouces are great and they have solid exeprices, assignments and projects to do in the course. But they are not the 100% fit to your attitude for learning. So make sure your attitude is first, then the stanford is second. Stanford goal is to reach to more people. Make it more accessable for people, not for you only.

Assembly code has a several parts 1) name of the function and the memory address where the code for this function starts, 2) Memory addresses and corresponding machine code in hexadecimal codes. Different instruction has different byte lengths. 3) human readible version of the assemble code for each instruction.


Each instruction has an operation name (opcode). Each instruction can also have arguments (operands). There are different opcodes. Some opcodes like add, mov,ld, st, etc, may have arguments with them like $0x1,%eax;


truth is that c-code allows us to write code, work with variables, types in higher level abstraction so we are machine or assemble agnostic!

Each processor has a registers

In x86 there are 16 registers available. They store a variables. They are fast read/write memory slots.
Data which needs to be calculated is moved to the register first. So instruction one is to write to the register. second instruction is to read from register and do logital operation on it like 'NOT'. 


Example:
-------
int sum = x + y;  ||||  1) copy x into register 1; 2) copy y into register 2, 3) add register 1 and register 2; 4) write register 1 to memory for sum.



Instruction sets are x86-64; ARM, MIPS, RISC-V
ATmega328 is a chip in most Arduino. It is based on the RISC 8bit Hardard architecture. Performance is 20 MHz.
SRAM is 2 KB, Flash memory (32 KB?)


ESP32-C3 is on NodeMCU board. It has a single-core 32-bit RISC-V CPU with 160MHz clock. It has a wifi and a bluetooth support too!


https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs107/cs107.1258/lectures/10/Lecture10.pdf

We can retrieve the information with a gcc and assembler code.

mov    $0x0,%rdx  -> maybe long x = 0;
mov    %rdx,%rcx  -> maybe long x = y;
mov    $0x42,(%rdi) -> maybe *ptr = 0x42;
mov    (%rax,%rcx,8),%rax  ->  maybe long x = arr[i];

https://godbolt.org/ --> multi compliter-assembly code review!!
It has all of them! Both ARM, x86-64, RISC-V, etc.

%rip register stores the address of the next instruction to execute (it is in x86-64),
Instrcutions are just bytes. In memory we have stack, heat, data and text (code). All instruction is just a byte at special address. Program counter (PC) is the well known name for %rip. In the end of each instuction there is a %rip% instruction.


Python code does not compile, instead it is interpreted with python3.12, python3.10 and etc. They follow similar assembly format.


Practice the arduino or ESP-C3 code.   

Yes, maybe I do not know the hardware, but I am sure the answer is pretty obvious from the combination in toolbox. I do not know the SR Latch. But it is basically a set/reset latch block. It is such a special block so it has a state of 1 bit.





Why TSMC is the most well-known FAB? What kind of business does other chip maker companies do? Sell chips to customer. But except TSMC, and maybe GlobalFoundries, other can not share their chip designs companies like Samsung. So the fabless companies mostly rely on TSMC. Their business model win over Intel and samsung for such long turn because its founder submission and his founder saw every ups and down of chips from first day of transistor productions. Taiwanese behemoth.  Jack Kilby invented the chip and Morri Chang is the founder of the TSMC. 



What is the Ohm's Law? I remember there were a ampher, Resistance, power, https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/chpt-2/voltage-current-resistance-relate/ (recommended)
Resistance, current, power, etc.

Electricity: When is it created? How is it created? Write questions to help people to discover! Do not write them description, just give hints, so their brain may work.
DC and AC?? Omp formula?
Logical Gates, Arithmetics Gates?


FPGA implementation fo the nand2: https://gitlab.com/x653/nand2tetris-fpga/-/tree/master/00_Requirement?ref_type=heads

There are many directions and many paths some of the are very deep while some of them shallow. You may get stuck with such hardware stuff for a long time. You can for sure build a pc, 8bit pc. But I need you to build it by yourself. No direct help. You may get a hints, otherwise you will not have a proper golden path history in your brain, to which you can rely anytime in the future! It is expensive path to obtain, yet worthwhile.

It works based on the instructions of the chip. Inctructions are special bit patterns like 0011001 or 001000010 etc, where it maps to logic or arithmetic or etc instructions. In this instruction, device find opcode, input memory address, output memory address if necessary.

Build own instructions? RISC-V si good fundamental
------
each instruction is like access a RAM, init a register, do arithmetics
------
Each instructions is run in basic gates like XOR, OR, AND, NAND, which are consist of CMOS circuits. CMOS - Complementary MOSFET circuits. These curcuits input 0 and/or 1 based on the power given. CMOS consists of two complemnetary transistors, NMOS, PMOS. The simpliest CMOS circuit is inverter (INV) (NOT) logic; From it NAND component can be created! Source is github os01/Operating_Systems_From_0_to_1.pdf

Instuctions then are performed based on the clock rate, instruction name

Remember we need to be thanksful for what we have now and what kind of power we are responsible for (we are controlling)!


FPGAs are an abstraction for building own instructions, editing own instrctions.These instructions can be programmable because FPGAs are a huge collection of logical gates all together. Can I say that I can create my new logic gate with fpga? I think no. They whole logic gates are preinstalled to the fpgas. You cannot add new component directly. You can use arduino kit, breadboard and a small power to do your own.

We write an assamly code into the file and save it. Then the computer calls assembler to read the file and fetch instructions. How is the first assembly is created? When we have only instructions and opcodes. So people write them by hand. A person was an assembler at that time. We have instructions as an array of binary patterns of maybe length of 10bit values. First 2 bit may represend the opcode, the remaining 8 bit may represent a register or memory address and so on.

Each computer processor each core implement the following process:
1) Fetch an instruction bit pattern from a storage device.
2) Decode the instructions. What is each bit stands for.
3) Execute the instructions.
4) Go back to 1) step.

The Apollo space program from 1961-1972, was built entirely with NOR gates. 

As time goes by, people realized that many pieces of assembly code had repeating patterns of usage. Yes assembly language is a step up (new convinient abstraction over writing raw 0 and 1 instructions by hand). The people at that time said it would be nice if instead of writing all the repeating blocks of code all over again in all places, we simply refer to such blocks of code with easier to use text forms. For example,a block of assembly code checks whether one variable is greater than another and if so, execute a block of code, else execute another block of code. In C, such block of assembly code is represented by an if statement that is close to human language.Instead of whole block of assembly where person needs to write which address to access, what to compare, what arithmetics to do, instead replace with if else statements which behind the scene do the equivalent with help of compiler. The program which translates such text forms to machine code is called a compiler. First practical compiler was written in 1951 by Corrado Bohm (italian computer scientist, source: wikipedia).


Remember!
  Any software logic a programming language can implement, hardware can also implement. The reverse is also true: any hardware logic that is implemented in a curcuit can be reimplemented in a programming language. The simple reason is that programming languages, or assembly languages, or machine languages, or logic gates are just languages to express computations. At the end of the day, programming languages are tranlated to machine instructions that are valid to a CPU or GPU and so on.

 In programming languages spectrum we have low level and high level languages. Some high level languages are Python, Java?, Go.A python programmer cannot manipulate underlying hardware, despite being able to deliver the same computations as low-level languages. C is low level language. It can control the underlying hardware better. You can control the memory and do with it what you want. You can achieve better performance for that hardware. High-level languages hide hardware details to free programmer from dealing with irrelevant details not related to current problem domains. Such convenience is not free: it requires software to carry an extra code for managing hardware details like garbage collector (memory) thus making the code run slower, and it makes hardware programming difficult or impossible. it creates weak programmers in terms of debugging the complexity (they will be far from the earth, for from reality). C is a thin abstruction (wrapper) for writing operating systems. It is easy to debug C code for the hardware.

Abstruction is a way of hiding a complexity that is irrelevant to the problem in context. For example, writing programs without any other layer expect the lowest layer: with circuits. Not only person needs in-depth understanding of how circuits work, making it much more obscure to design a circuit because the designer must look at the raw circuits but think in higher-level such as logic gates. It is same as solving math problem not straight with formula or linear algebra but use arithmetics. 

Why abstruction works!
1) Logic gates abstract away the details of CMOS circuits.
2) Machine language abstract away the logic gates, arithmetic gates, switches, clock, selector, RAM, register, switch, etc
3) Assembly language abstract away the details of machine languages
4) Programming languages abstracts away the details of assembly languages.


Logic gates hides the l anguage of circuits and focuses on how to implement primitive Boolean functions and combine them to create new functions. All logic gates receive input and generate output as binary numbers.

Human already developed a systematic discipline for studying patterns: Mathematics! Quote from G. H. Hardy (2005): A mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas.

Isn't that a mathematical formula a representation of a pattern? Mathematics provides a formal system to identify and describe existing patterns in nature.

Linux is full of applications controlled by many domain-specific lamguages and are placed in /etc directory, such as a web server. Instead od reprogramming the software, a domain-agnostic language is made for it.


#------------------CHAPTER 3 of Operating Systems from 0 to 1 bby os01 github repo----------------------
-------------------Computer Architecture-------------------
To write lower level code, a programmer must know the set of instructions of the computer, all other hardware components like memory, buses, and so on.
In the literature we have general-purpose computer and single-purpose computers.
A Server is a general-purpose computers (high-performance computer).
Desktop is general-purpose computer too!
Mobile computers! Game consoles! 
Another type of computers are embedded computers. An Embedded computer is a single-board or single-chip with limited resources designed for integrating into larger hardware devices. A microcontroller is an mbedded computer design for controlling other hardware devices. Microcontroller is general-purpose computers. They have limited resources. It has a chip or logic gates inside. Another type of embedded computer is system-on-chip. System-on-chip is a full computer on a single chip. Microcontroller is designed to control other hardwares, while system-on-chip is designed to be a standalone computer in single chip. Apple A5, A11, M1, Qualcomm Snapdragon they are all system-on-chip.

PBC - Printed Circuit Board  is physical board that contains lines and pads to enable electron flows between electrical and electronics components. 
Writing a program for ebdedded devices is called embedded programming. Embedded computers are used in automatically controlled devices including power tools, toys, implantable medical devices, engines, appliances, remote controls, and so on.
SoC and microcontrollers has a blurry lines.  System-on-chip can perform all tasks of microcontroller while mictrocontroller can not do reverse. Software for microcontroller requires little computing resources. System-on-chip can easily support operating systems, but microcontrollers may not, except the latest ones. Raspberry Pi may have SoC by broadcom, or so on. This is the heart of almost all hardware companies.

FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) We can combine several chips and use them in sync, are not we? For example each 74HC00 chip can be configures as a gate, and we can build pwoerful chip by combining them. FPGA devices are an array of thousands of logical blocks (CMOS, mini-circuits) which are programmable with a languages such as Verilog. FPGAs can be optimized in such way that you can achieve true parallel computation and true fastest possible speed. Code in the FPGA are applied in a logic level, in level of circuits logics, while in the microcontroller or SoC, it is an assemble code or C or higher.
FPGAs are great when regular computers are slow or does nto fit the domain. For example, real-time medical image processing, cruise control system, video encoding/decoding, defense, finance etc. 

Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) is a chip designed for a particular purpose rather than for general-purpose use. ASIC is a final stage of FPGA chips. ASICs are very costly to implement because they are physical and manufacturing once done, it maybe impossible to change the circuit inside.

John von Neumann invented a computer architecture which is the original version of modern computers. CPU communicares with Control bus, Address bus, Data Bus. All these busses are in system bus. Busses are a wire or road to send raw bits between the above components. Instructions are stored in memoy (RAM or Disk) and the cpu fetches them via a data bus.

Many OS concepts are already implemented directly in hardware, e.g. task switching, paging, etc. A kernel programmer needs to know how to use the hardware features, to avoid duplicating such concepts in software, thus wasting computing resources. To effectively use the CPU, a programmer needs to understand the documentation provided from CPU manufacturer. After understanding one CPU architecture well, it is easier to learn other CPU architectures.
 Mainly the register is needed for .....??? They are needed for fast data transactions.
 What is the port in the CPU? Port is a specialized register in a hardware device used for communciation with other devices.
 What is a RAM? it is storage device! Applcation of a memory.
 What is a MCH?
 What is a Cache inside the chip then? they are used for dynamic programming concept, they are true optimizers of speed.

# x86 architecture
------------------
How to program an x86 CPU? There are three manuals writting for it  Volume I is almost 500 pages, Volume 2 is over 2000 pages, while volume 3 is 1000 pages.

Intel Q35 Chipset -- 2007;

#---------Chapter 4-----------
x86 Assembly and C
<<objdump>> entensively to read x86 assembly code.

$ objdump -d hello
It has many flags which is useful to learn. $ objdump -S hello | less and so on;

The assembly instructions has the following format:
The first column is an address of assembly instructions
The second column is the assembly instruction in hex values
The third column is the assembly instruciton. 
The optional fourth column is a comment appears when there is a reference to an address. 



Anatomy of an Assembly Instruction
----------------------------------

Anatomy of a Program
--------------------
Every program consists of code and data, and only those two components made up a program.
When a source file is compiled, the generated machine code is stored into an object file, which is just a block of binary.  One or more object files can be combined to produce an executable binary, which is complete program runnable in an operating system.
Each object file or executable binaries has an ELF binary;


<<readelf>> is a program that recognizes and displays the ELF metadata of a binary file, be itan object file or an executable binary. ELF - Executable and Linkable Format, is the content at the very beginning of an executable to provide an operating system necessary information to load into main memory and run the executable.


$ readelf -g a.out # it shows the ELF Header info


An ELF binary is composed of:
  - An ELF header: the very first section of an executable that describes the file's organization.
  - A program header table: is an array of fixed-size structures that describes segments of an executable.
  - A section header table: is an array of fixed-size structures that describes sections of an executable.
  - Segments and sections are the main content of an ELF binary, which are the code and data, divided into chunks of different purposes.
